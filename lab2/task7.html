        <h2>Generator of fake portraits
</h2>
<h3>People tend not to think about the effect that neural networks have on our lives, because usually, we see the result of
its work and not the "face" of a neural network. Perhaps that is why the generator of fake photos became the main topic
of discussion for several weeks in the media devoted to technology at the end of 2020. Not everyone was able to guess
that AI could generate a realistic face of a non-existent person in a couple of seconds. Fake portraits look very
realistic and it's frightening. If AI can create faces for itself and can text like real people, then what is going to
happen next?</h3>

<h3>We are talking about the website thispersondoesnotexist.com ("this person does not exist dot com") and are going to tell
of the history and areas of application. The way the generator works will be explained further.

The AI face generator is powered by StyleGAN, a neural network from Nvidia developed in 2018. GAN consists of 2
competing neural networks, one generates something, and the second tries to find whether results are real or generated
by the first. Training ends when the first neural network begins to constantly deceive the second.

An interesting point is that the creation of photographs of non-existent people was a by- product: the main goal was to
train the AI to recognize fake faces and faces in general. The company needed this to improve the performance of its
video cards by automatically recognizing faces and applying other rendering algorithms to them. However, since

the StyleGAN code is publicly available, an engineer at Uber was able to take it and create a random face generator that
rocked the internet</h3>
